# Heart_condition
A dataset containing age, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, CK-MB, Troponin and result

1. Cardiovascular Health Indicators:
Heart Rate: Typically measured in beats per minute (bpm). Normal resting heart rates range from 60 to 100 bpm.
Abnormal values might indicate cardiovascular issues.

Blood Pressure: Includes systolic (pressure when the heart beats) and diastolic (pressure when the heart rests between beats). Normal ranges are around 120/80 mmHg. High or low blood pressure can be linked to heart disease risk.

CK-MB (Creatine Kinase-MB): An enzyme found in the heart muscle. Elevated levels can indicate heart damage, such as a myocardial infarction (heart attack).

Troponin: A protein released into the blood when the heart muscle is damaged. Itâ€™s a key biomarker for diagnosing heart attacks.

Blood Sugar (Glucose): Elevated levels can indicate diabetes or other metabolic conditions, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

The heart attack datasets were collected at Zheen hospital in Erbil, Iraq, from January 2019 to May 2019. The attributes of this dataset are: age, gender, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood sugar, ck-mb and troponin with negative or positive output. According to the provided information, the medical dataset classifies either heart attack or none. The gender column in the data is normalized: the male is set to 1 and the female to 0. The glucose column is set to 1 if it is > 120; otherwise, 0. As for the output, positive is set to 1 and negative to 0.
